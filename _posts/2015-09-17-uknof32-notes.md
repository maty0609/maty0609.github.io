<b>Peering tools session - Reverse Path Filtering</b> (Matt Walster) <br>
This was unfortunately only presentation I have seen from UK and Ireland Peering Forum. Very interesting presentation about route filtering and how LINX avoids prefixes hijacking and any issues related to as-path attributes or propagating of private range subnets. Slides was full of configuration snippets. If you are interested how peering is done from technical/configuration point of view you should check slides. Slides will be released very soon.



An Update on the Openreach G.fast proof of Concept
In 10 years planned rollout up to 500MBit/s

NGA2 Trial
800-900 MBit/s measured in production

August 2015
First customers
Avg speed - downstream 300 MBit/s

NGA2 - G.Fast
50MBit/s upstream
300m is maximum distance for fibre

NGA2 - Fibre on demand
800MBit/s downstream
100MBit/s upstream

I had to leave as I had a call.

Evolution of Ethernet Speeds - What’s New and What’s Next
Still on the call but it is worth to check slides. From what I have heard there was very interesting discussion after the presentation.


Post-burnout presenting: what I learned about how not to persuade people
Yeah it was a long call.......

bgpq3
This session wasn't even announced in official agenda. It was very short introduction of bgpq3 tool. If you are looking for the tool to automatically generate route filters for particular ASN this is the way to go. You just enter ASN and it will generate syntax for Juniper or Cisco - feel free to contribute as they are looking for the developers to help them with syntax for other platforms. They are using ix-f.net database (http://www.ix-f.net/ixp-database.html). 

The $1,000 internet exchange
Interesting presentation how to start your own IXP. Based on true story! Check the slides with all the details.


Internet History Talk - Great British IXP Failures
Confession of Keith about the biggest mistake of his career. 


Google datacentre networking
Main requirement in Google's DCs is flat low latency bandwidth across the whole DC
Google had meeting with major vendors in 2003 to discuss new generation network device but vendor was able to satisfy their requirements. Therefore Google has decided to start developing their own devices. It made also sense since they are running only their own applications. Phil described the whole history of google switches from Firehose till current state-of-art Saturn switches. 

They don't need large L2 domains but rather isolated L3 domains designed as leaf-spine network. Major part of application communicates on L3 rather than on L2. Since 2003 they are running OpenFlow to separate control from data plane. Additionally each ToR switch talks to other ToR switches. 

According to Google more than 90% stays within DC. Less than 10% of traffic leaves the DC. Therefore major part of traffic is east-to-west rather than south-to-north.



How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Network
Facebook has large network (surprise!) which access about 1bn users from around the world. They have huge range of tools to operate the network on day bases and automate things as much as it possible. Few tools which sounds interesting to me:

Fibnet - Database to program the network for wide range of tasks - from circuit maintenance across swapping linecards to adding or removing BGP peers.

Drain ???? - redirecting traffic. No idea how this is done but my guess is via LISP or MPLS.

Megazord - tool which aggregates errors. They have MASSIVE amount of information what is happening on the network. For instance 10 machines are down. This tool find that these machines are at the same rack. Therefore first guess is that power is down. However switch is reachable therefore must be something wrong with the switch. It will than report that there is something wrong with the switch.

All these tools has been recycled rather than created. Megazord was firstly developed for servers but it has been amended for network purposes. The main fact is that Facebook internally shares the code of all the tools which has been developed and re-using/recycling it.

Analysis of F-root placement using RIPE Atlas
Unfortunately had a call.

Using BGP for real-time import and export of spam whitelist/blacklist entries
Interesting idea of distributing spam whitelist/blacklist via BGP. There is huge potential for this I think. Obviously there are more popular ways how to do the distribution via SpamAssasian etc. but this has many advantages - faster reaction time, immediate updates, scalability. On the other hand I think it can't be deployed everywhere - you are reliable on somebody who run these 'route reflectors'. Any mistakes are propagated quicker than you are able to react. There are deployments where you wouldn't deploy any Linux distributions with rolling updates so there will be always deployments where you wouldn't deploy 'rolling spam updates' via BGP. However very interesting idea.

Verizon's DBIR
Not my cup of tea. Lot of talking about importance to educate employees make them rather your allies than enemies in company security. Phishing is still largest threat. Global decrease in frauds.
